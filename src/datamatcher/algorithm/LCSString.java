/**
 * This is an implementation, in Java, of the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm.
 * That is, given two strings A and B, this program will find the longest sequence
 * of letters that are common and ordered in A and B.
 *
 * There are only two reasons you are reading this:
 *   - you don't care what the algorithm is but you need a piece of code to do it
 *   - you're trying to understand the algorithm, and a piece of code might help
 * In either case, you should either read an entire chapter of an algorithms textbook
 * on the subject of dynamic programming, or you should consult a webpage that describes
 * this particular algorithm.   It is important, for example, that we use arrays of size
 * |A|+1 x |B|+1.
